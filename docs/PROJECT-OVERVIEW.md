# Oratrice project overview

This document summarizes the M1-M8 delivery history, current architecture, and
accepted limitations. Test counts refer only to recorded validation runs; live
model evidence and offline pytest results are intentionally kept separate.

## Product vision

Oratrice is a local-first, provider-neutral personal AI core. It gives desktop,
CLI, and Web frontends one stable API while keeping model runtimes, gateways,
and cloud providers replaceable behind explicit contracts.

The Core does not depend on a concrete model vendor. Gemma acts as a routing
model, not as the final conversational model. LiteLLM is the gateway boundary,
GPT-OSS is the default local text model, Qwen-VL is an optional deferred vision
path, and DeepSeek is an opt-in cloud candidate.

```

The main boundaries are:

- `core/`: configuration, composition, facade, registries, and lifecycle.
- `router/`: structured route decisions and policy evaluation only.
- `providers/`: transport-neutral provider contracts and adapters.
- `launcher/`: ordered startup, readiness gates, reuse, and owned-process
  cleanup.
- `oratrice_api/`: strict FastAPI DTOs, safe errors, and health endpoints.
- `frontends/web/`: a thin same-origin client with no model or provider logic.

## Milestone summary

| Milestone | Delivered | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | Configuration, registry, llama.cpp and LiteLLM adapters, local profile, direct Qwen-VL smoke | Required local path PASS; gateway vision deferred |
| M2 | Declarative launch plan, orchestrator, CLI, Windows launcher | Offline orchestration and dry-run PASS |
| M3 | Capability-aware routing policy and Gemma composition | Composition gate PASS; router remains decision-only |
| M4 | `/chat`, `/route`, `/health`, lifecycle, safe API errors | API and launcher/API gates PASS |
| M5 | Offline release gate, alias resolution, profile propagation, transport mapping | Release gate PASS within the bounded attempt ledger |
| M6 | Release/health contracts, doctor, portable launcher, environment bootstrap | Historically blocked by the LiteLLM environment |
| M7 | Rebuilt isolated environments, cross-process readiness, real required chain | GPT-OSS/Gemma/LiteLLM/Core live chain PASS; overall DEGRADED for resource caveats |
| M8 | Bundled Web UI, logging hardening, public aliases, release validation | Required functional chain PASS; V0.1 overall DEGRADED |

## Current request path

```text
Web UI -> Core API -> CoreFacade -> Gemma Router -> LiteLLM -> GPT-OSS
```

The default required startup order is GPT-OSS on port 8080, Gemma Router on
8090, LiteLLM on 4000, and Core API on 8000. The bundled UI is served from
`/ui/` by the Core API, so it adds no process or port.

## Validation snapshot

- Current offline suite: `150 passed` during public-release preparation.
- GitHub portable checks: Windows/Python 3.13 CI.
- Required M8 live UI, readiness, routing, and chat path: PASS.
- Secrets, model weights, virtual environments, logs, and runtime output are
  excluded from the repository.

## Accepted limitations

1. The supplied live profile targets the maintainer's `D:\AI` layout and must
   be copied and adjusted on another host.
2. Qwen-VL through LiteLLM remains deferred. Direct llama.cpp vision evidence
   does not prove the gateway path.
3. DeepSeek requires explicit cloud opt-in and `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`; it is not
   part of the default local route.
4. M8 confirmed listener shutdown under Codex ConPTY but did not prove complete
   launcher-owned process reaping. The experimental handler variants were
   reverted.
5. Peak live-chain measurements left little RAM and VRAM headroom. High
   concurrency, long contexts, continuous uptime, and simultaneous Qwen use
   are not validated.

## Maintenance rules

- Add models and providers through configuration and adapter registries rather
  than branching in the Core.
- Keep the router decision-only and the Web UI API-only.
- Keep cloud use explicit and secrets environment-backed.
- Treat offline tests and live model validation as separate evidence.
- Preserve the three-attempt diagnostic limit for a single unchanged path.
- Do not introduce Memory, Tools, Agents, voice, or autonomous behavior as an
  incidental infrastructure change.
